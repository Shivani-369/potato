AI model to detect potato internal defects (hollow heart, black heart, necrosis, etc.)

🥔 Potato Defect Detector
An AI-powered system to detect internal defects in potatoes (e.g., Hollow Heart, Black Heart, Internal Heat Necrosis) before they reach buyers.
This helps reduce wastage, disputes, and financial loss in the supply chain.

🚀 Problem Statement
Invisible internal defects in potatoes are hard to detect manually.
Our goal is to build a non-invasive AI system that classifies potatoes into:

✅ Healthy
❌ Defective (Hollow Heart, Black Heart, Necrosis, etc.)
