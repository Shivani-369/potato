# 🥔 Potato Defect Detector

## 📖 Overview
Potatoes often suffer from hidden internal defects such as **blackheart, hollow heart, and necrosis**, which reduce quality and market value. This project leverages **deep learning** to automatically classify potatoes as **healthy** or **defective** using image data.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Detect potato defects early and accurately.  
- Provide an end-to-end pipeline: **data → training → evaluation → prediction**.  
- Offer a simple **web app interface** for real-world usability.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Images are cleaned, labeled, and split.  
2. **Model Training** – CNN/ResNet-based models learn defect patterns.  
3. **Evaluation** – Performance measured via accuracy, precision, recall.  
4. **Prediction** – Upload a potato image → get instant classification.
